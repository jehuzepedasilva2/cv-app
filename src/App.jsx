// Application should include...
// 1. section to add general information (name, email, phone)
// 2. section to add educational experience (school name, title of study, date of study)
// 3. section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities, date from and until)
// include edit and submit buttons for each section or the whole cv.

// ideas: it look like just page, where, when you click in a name/experience/date, you are able 
// to update it in real time.
